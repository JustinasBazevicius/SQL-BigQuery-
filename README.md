In this project, I created queries to solve specific business questions using a database. The focus was on exploring tables, identifying necessary data, and effectively merging it.

## Tasks Overview:

1. **Customer Overview**: Created a detailed overview of individual customers, including identity, contact, location, and sales information.
2. **Inactive Customers**: Identified top customers who havenâ€™t ordered in the last 365 days.
3. **Active Customers**: Marked customers as active or inactive based on their order history.
4. **North America Customers**: Extracted data for active customers with specific order criteria.

## Reporting Sales:

1. **Monthly Sales Numbers**: Queried monthly sales figures by country and region.
2. **Cumulative Sales**: Enhanced the sales query with cumulative totals.
3. **Sales Ranking**: Ranked sales per country based on total amounts earned.
4. **Tax Analysis**: Analyzed average tax rates and province representation.
