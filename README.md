# SQL-BigQuery-
In this project, I created queries to solve specific business questions using a database. The focus was on exploring tables, identifying necessary data, and effectively merging it.

Tasks Overview:
Customer Overview: Created a detailed overview of individual customers, including identity, contact, location, and sales information.
Inactive Customers: Identified top customers who haven’t ordered in the last 365 days.
Active Customers: Marked customers as active or inactive based on their order history.
North America Customers: Extracted data for active customers with specific order criteria.

Reporting Sales:
Monthly Sales Numbers: Queried monthly sales figures by country and region.
Cumulative Sales: Enhanced the sales query with cumulative totals.
Sales Ranking: Ranked sales per country based on total amounts earned.
Tax Analysis: Analyzed average tax rates and province representation.
